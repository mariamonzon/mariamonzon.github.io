Her aim is to develop robust and trustworthy Deep Learning algorithms for solving computer vision problems in Bioscience.\nShe was granted a study scholarship for graduating with honors in highschool. She received his B.Sc. in Telecommunication Technology Engineering from the Basque Country University (UPV-EHU), including one semester abroad in Germany with the help of an Erasmus scholarship. She completed her bachelor thesis at BioRes group with excellent grade. In parallel, she attended a micro-master in Formation and Entrepreneurship in Biomedical Engineering (UPV-EHU).\nRight after, she moved to Germany to pursue an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in data and image processing major. During her studies, Maria worked on multiple university-related and personal research projects in the areas of Deep Learning for Computer Vision and Biomedical Image and Signal analysis. She completed her master thesis at Siemens Healthineers, where she worked with PD. Dr. Daniel Giese and Prof. Andreas Maier on developing novel deep learning algorithms assessment of cardiac valve motion on time-resolved Magnetic Resonance Images. After her master, Maria did an Erasmus+ internship at Bitbrain Technologies, where she developed machine learning algorithms for decoding grasping action from EEG brain signals. Since then, Maria has worked as a research engineer at BASF R\u0026amp;D, where she developed state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to solve Computational Life Science Problems.\nHer current research interests include Computer Vision, Biomedical Image Analysis, Trustworhty Deep Learning and Machine Learning for Healthcare. I care about efficient coding and reproducible research.\n","date":1589932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1589932800,"objectID":"b03c33f81ebea2a2b496594d6693eae3","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Maria Monzon is a Computer Vision Researcher on Advance Image Analysis Group at BASF.

Dynamic motion parameters can be extracted from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. We propose two chained Convolutional Neural Networks for automatic tracking of mitral valve-annulus landmarks on time-resolved 2-chamber and 4-chamber CMR images. The first network is trained to detect the region of interest and the second to track the landmarks along the cardiac cycle. We successfully extracted several motion-related parameters with high accuracy as well as analyzed unlabeled datasets, thereby overcoming time-consuming annotation and allowing statistical analysis over large number of datasets","tags":["Deep Learning","MRI"],"title":"Fully automatic extraction of mitral valve annulus motion parameters on long axis CINE CMR using deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Jin","Maria Monzon","Teodora Chitiboi","Aaron Pruitt","Daniel Giese","Matthew Tong","Orlando P Simonetti"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
